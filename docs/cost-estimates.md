## Cost Optimization Strategies

### For All Phases
- Implement AWS Reserved Instances for steady-state workloads (30-60% savings)
- Utilize AWS Savings Plans for consistent compute usage
- Implement lifecycle policies for S3 storage
- Monitor and rightsize instances based on actual usage

### Phase-Specific Optimizations

#### Phase 1 & 2
- Use serverless components where possible to reduce idle costs
- Implement aggressive caching to reduce compute needs
- Optimize database queries to minimize instance size requirements

#### Phase 3
- Implement regional data strategies to reduce data transfer costs
- Consider AWS Graviton instances for cost-efficient computing
- Implement data lifecycle management to reduce storage costs

#### Phase 4
- Negotiate enterprise discounts with cloud provider
- Consider hybrid cloud approach for predictable workloads
- Implement advanced auto-scaling based on machine learning predictions

## Revenue Models to Offset Costs

### Freemium Model
- Basic tier: Free, limited features, ad-supported
- Premium tier: $4.99/month, full features, no ads
- Business tier: $19.99/month, advanced analytics, API access

### Affiliate Revenue
- Estimated revenue per 1,000 active users: $200-500/month
- Retail partnership program for promoted deals

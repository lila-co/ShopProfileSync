# SmartCart Scalability Plan

## Architecture Optimizations

### Database Scalability
- **Connection Pooling**: Implement proper connection pooling with the PostgreSQL database
- **Read/Write Splitting**: Prepare for eventual separation of read and write operations
- **Database Sharding Strategy**: Plan for horizontal scaling by customer region/location
- **Caching Layer**: Implement Redis for high-frequency data (deals, retailer info)

### Application Scalability
- **Microservice Boundaries**: 
  - User Authentication Service
  - Shopping List Service
  - Retailer Integration Service
  - Analytics & Recommendations Service
  - Circular & Deals Service
- **Stateless Design**: Ensure all services are stateless for horizontal scaling
- **Load Balancing**: Implement round-robin with sticky sessions

### API Optimization
- **GraphQL Implementation**: Reduce over-fetching of data
- **API Rate Limiting**: Implement tiered rate limiting based on user plans
- **Data Pagination**: All list endpoints support pagination
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimize database queries with proper indexing

### Background Processing
- **Job Queue System**: Implement message queue for heavy operations
  - Receipt Processing Queue
  - Recommendation Generation Queue
  - Analytics Processing Queue
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Isolate recurring tasks like deal updates

## Infrastructure Considerations

### Containerization
- Docker containers for all services
- Kubernetes for orchestration

### Cloud Deployment
- Auto-scaling groups for application servers
- CDN for static assets and images
- Edge caching for frequent requests

### Monitoring & Observability
- Application Performance Monitoring
- Real-time alerting system
- Detailed logging with sampling in high-volume scenarios

## Growth Phases

### Phase 1: Up to 10,000 Users
- Single database with proper indexing
- Vertical scaling of application servers
- Basic caching implementation

### Phase 2: 10,000-100,000 Users
- Read replicas for database
- Implement CDN and edge caching
- Begin service separation for high-load components

### Phase 3: 100,000-1,000,000 Users
- Full microservice architecture
- Database sharding
- Regional deployments
- Advanced caching strategies

### Phase 4: 1,000,000+ Users
- Multi-region deployment
- Dedicated database clusters
- Custom-optimized infrastructure

## Performance Targets

- API Response Times: <200ms for 95% of requests
- Image Loading: <1s for 95% of images
- Background Jobs: <5min for receipt processing
- Recommendation Generation: <30s for personalized recommendations
